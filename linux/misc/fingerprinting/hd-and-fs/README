A resonable 'fingerprint' based upon a two pieces of datum; 
namly: partition layout and device serial.
to further the integrity of this approach one might make a map of currently
utilized and non utilized inodes to create a 'fingerprint snapshot' on a 
filesystem basis.

To compile either run ./z or 
make clean target=main
and then
make target=main
afterwards
./main /dev/devicelocation
(ex: /dev/sda)
